## Problem
A regular octahedron is shown in the diagram below. There are 6 vertices altogether connected by a total of 12 edges. An ant starts from vertex A and moves along any edge but cannot go through any edge more than once. If the ant visits each vertex exactly once before it returns to vertex A, how many different routes are there?
